JP2024152905A,Method and apparatus for instantaneous on-line carbonation of water through electrostatic charging,"To provide a carbonation apparatus for carbonating a mixed input flow of pressurized and refrigerated carbon dioxide and water.SOLUTION: A first cartridge is disposed within a carbonation chamber, defining a porous micromesh net in fluid communication with the input flow and a central cavity in fluid communication with a carbonation chamber output port. The micromesh net is configured to break up chains of water molecules passing through the net, so as to enhance bonding between the water molecules and carbon dioxide molecules within the cartridge. The net also responds to a flow of the water and carbon dioxide molecules impacting and passing through the net by generating a passive polarizing field that has a polarizing effect on the water molecules, so as to further enhance the bonding. Beads may be provided within the cartridge for capturing and stabilizing carbon dioxide molecules, so as to yet further enhance the bonding between the water molecules and the carbon dioxide molecules.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 4b","<div class=""indep-clm"" num=""1"">【請求項1】</div>

MX2023014176A,Hard taco shell and method for producing the hard taco shell.,"A taco shell (10) is produced by applying a plasticizing agent (coating 100) to a base or spine portion (25) of a hard taco shell, such as by targeted spraying, rolling, brushing or dipping of the taco shell, thereby softening the base or spine portion (25), preferably across a strip width between 4mm-20mm. As a result, when the taco shell (10) is bitten, the softened base portion (25) has some hinging flexibility or pliability which reduces the potential for any crack propagation. Therefore, the structural integrity of the hard taco shell (10) can be better maintained while be eaten, resulting in retention of the fillings and less mess. If desired, an anti- migration agent can also be applied to assure containment of the plasticizing agent in the targeted region.",,"A23L7/117, A21D2/18, A21D8/02, A21D13/20, A21D13/22",20240111,GENERAL MILLS INC.,['Pending']

As a further result, when the taco shell is bitten, the softened targeted region has some hinging flexibility or pliability which reduces the potential for any crack propagation. Therefore, the structural integrity of the hard taco shell can be better maintained during packaging and while be eaten, resulting in retention of the fillings and less mess.

An embodiment operates by obtaining data for a first product, a second product, and a target product. The data include a set of sparse data points for the target product. Next, similarity scores between the target product and the first product and the second product may be calculated. The embodiment further operates by generating a target MLM associated with the target product using a regularization penalty. The regularization penalty is based on the similarity scores and distances between a target set of coefficients for the target MLM and coefficients for a first MLM and a second MLM associated with the first product and the second product, respectively. The embodiment may then detect an anomaly associated with the target product by feeding the target MLM with a feature vector associated with the target product.","1.
